# LIGHTWATCH: Project Vision

## Overview

LIGHTWATCH is a 143-second real-time art piece. A meditation on connection, loss, and the vastness of time.

## The Story

Five travelers—ancient beings who found each other across cosmic distances—left beacons broadcasting their final transmissions. The viewer receives this signal 14.3 billion years later.

They witness:
- **Connection** — The warmth of finding others in infinite darkness
- **Loss** — The gradual dimming of lights, one by one
- **Silence** — The peace that comes after

## The Experience

This is not a game. This is not interactive beyond the initial trigger. The viewer clicks once, and becomes witness to something that happened eons ago.

### Visual Philosophy

- **During the Bang**: Overwhelming. Blinding. The birth of everything.
- **During Connection**: Beautiful. Warm. The dance of lights finding harmony.
- **During Acceptance**: Haunting. Peaceful. The slow embrace of entropy.

### Audio Philosophy

Each traveler has a voice—a unique frequency, a leitmotif that speaks their nature. When they connect, their voices harmonize. When they fade, their melodies dissolve into silence.

## Why 143 Seconds?

- 143 seconds = 14.3 billion years compressed
- Each second represents 100 million years
- The age of our universe, experienced in the span of a breath

## Target Quality

AAA-quality dream sequence rendered in real-time. This should feel like:
- The opening of *2001: A Space Odyssey*
- The cosmic scenes in *Interstellar*
- The emotional weight of *Journey* (thatgamecompany)

No compromises on visual fidelity. No compromises on emotional impact.

## Success Criteria

When someone experiences LIGHTWATCH, they should:
1. Feel small against the cosmos
2. Feel the warmth of connection
3. Feel the weight of loss
4. Sit in silence when it ends

If they immediately want to watch again, we succeeded.
